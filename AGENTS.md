# dm-bot plugin tools

This repo uses a CLI-based tool system for AI agents.

## How to call tools

Each plugin exposes tools via bash:

\`\`\`bash
bun src/cli.ts <alias> <toolName> '<json>'
bun src/cli.ts <alias>              # print full JSON schema for plugin
bun src/cli.ts                      # list all plugins and tools
\`\`\`

## Draft system

All mutating operations (create, update, delete) return a **draft** for user review.
The user accepts/revises/declines via bot DM commands shown in the tool output.
Never retry a mutating tool if it returned a Draft ID.

## Skills

**All** official agent guidance for this repo lives under `.claude/skills/`. When you work in this workspace, **read every skill** in that directory.

Each skill is a folder: `.claude/skills/<skill_name>/SKILL.md` (OpenCode-compatible YAML frontmatter with `name` matching `<skill_name>`).

## Web command UI

Rich command output uses `WebNodeRoot` and optional per-render `stylesheets` (Shadow DOM). See `docs/WEB_RENDERER.md` (section “Scoped styles”).
